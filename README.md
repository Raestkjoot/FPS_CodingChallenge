# FPS Coding Challenge

Coding project for UltimaStudios' programmer test. Goal was to create a simple FPS game using the FPS template and make a functioning menu.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# The Result

There is a main menu with a settings menu that allows you to choose a basic graphics setting: low, medium or high. There's also a pause menu and a game over menu.
The game itself is of course implemented with the basic FPS template. 

Using a mix of C++ and blueprint, I added some gameplay elements: sprinting and aiming, as well as some turrets to spice things up. The player can shoot and destroy the turrets while trying to avoid the projectiles that the turrets shoot at the player.
